## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STEPS (3 Easy Steps!)

### Step 1: Prepare Files for Upload

**Option A - ZIP Upload (Recommended):**
1. Navigate to the `out` folder
2. Select ALL contents inside the `out` folder (not the folder itself)
3. Right-click → "Compress to ZIP file" or "Send to → Compressed folder"
4. Name it: `fp-website-deployment.zip`

**Option B - Direct Upload:**
- You can upload the contents of the `out` folder directly via FTP or Plesk File Manager

---

### Step 2: Upload to Plesk

1. **Log into Plesk Control Panel**
   - Go to your Plesk hosting URL
   - Enter your credentials

2. **Navigate to File Manager**
   - Click on "Files" in the sidebar
   - Click "File Manager"

3. **Go to Website Root Directory**
   - Navigate to `httpdocs/` or `public_html/` (depends on your hosting)
   - This is where your website files should go

4. **Upload Files**
   - If using ZIP: Click "Upload" → Select your ZIP file → Wait for upload → Click "Extract"
   - If using direct upload: Select all files from `out` folder and upload

5. **Verify File Structure**
   After extraction, your root directory should contain:
   ```
   httpdocs/
   ├── _next/              (folder with JS/CSS)
   ├── about/              (about page folder)
   ├── cfp/                (CFP page folder)
   ├── contact/            (contact page folder)
   ├── cpd/                (CPD pages folder)
   ├── events/             (events page folder)
   ├── media/              (media page folder)
   ├── scfp-hnwi/          (SCFP pages folder)
   ├── index.html          (homepage)
   ├── 404.html            (error page)
   ├── FP logo.png         (logo)
   └── slider-*.webp       (slider images)
   ```
