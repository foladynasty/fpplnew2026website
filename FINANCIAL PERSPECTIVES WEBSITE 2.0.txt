📋 CONTENT PHILOSOPHY
Homepage Purpose: Tease, inspire, and compel action—NOT provide exhaustive details.
Approach:
•	Create desire and intrigue
•	Highlight benefits and outcomes, not module lists
•	Use compelling CTAs that drive clicks to detailed course pages
•	Keep sections focused and punchy
•	Save comprehensive breakdowns for dedicated program pages
Remember: The homepage gets people interested. Dedicated course pages close the deal.
